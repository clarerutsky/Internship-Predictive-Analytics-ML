                    Problem Statement:
In the financial industry, it is crucial for lenders to assess the
creditworthiness of borrowers before granting loans or credit. Identifying
potential defaulters, who are at higher risk of failing to repay their debts,
can help mitigate financial losses and maintain a healthy lending portfolio.
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can
accurately classify borrowers as defaulters or non-defaulters based on
various financial and demographic factors
